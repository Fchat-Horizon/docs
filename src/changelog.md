# [Releases]

## [1.32.0] - 2025-06-15

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to _downgrade_ from 1.32.0 or later to an earlier version, you will need to manually delete the `eicon.json` file in your Horizon data folder, or the EIcon search window might not show all results anymore.
> Please consult [this](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) file on where to find this folder.
> For regular users, this should be no concern though.

### Added

- New EIcon Selector and Store update, significantly improving the EIcon selection UI and handling. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2439abc9253ca87a510d3ac5bc8abded9f1b5d68)
  - You should see a **_massive_** decrease in memory per tab now, and searching for eicons is now a lot snappier.
  - Also fixes some issues where searchig for EIcons with a leading space wouldn't work. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b88290eef690fdd3111abae52b6c41124b3e8663)
  - _Also_ fixes the EIcon search potentially messing up if Xariah's API is having issues. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/130d91b7fca64740cf7c08ca05f768fc83d3c0e6)
  - Special thanks to @FireUnderTheMountain for helping investigate this, and subsequently writing the PR.
- Experimental gender matcher rework (community feedback appreciated). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/7b35203e4e77245ff1864fcf505646bd55855b00)
  - Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/pull/173).
  - TL;DR: Gender and orientation are now a single score, determined primarily by your default kink gender preferences, while your orientation is used as a fallback. Orientation matching for nonbinary characters is also less dogmatic now.
  - More changes to the matcher are planned, including reassessing how species are determined.
- Consistency applied to most instances of the app name. We are now just "Horizon". [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8f6abc30ffcfd6cfd1b1e4f64e494b56efbff1da)
  - We have a _temporary_ new logo to go with this change. If you don't like it, don't worry: We'll replace it with something better and less temporary soon enough.

## [1.31.0] - 2024-05-09

> [!WARNING]
> This is a major update!
> Please, back up your logs.

### Added

- A new setting to notify you when a friend or bookmark logs in. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/c5b401f59db98450ceede0818c9f85d74a95e737)
- The 'Smart Filter' automated reply message can now be customized. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3edab4956b0121cd711c1e67abb4d279bdfcd69d)
  - This also shuffles the related settings around, and hopefully explains the system a bit better.
- A new setting to display gender symbols next to character names. [\[Commit\]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1ae7b9cd2c634b481e83aaee5823627a06decb8c)
  - These symbols can (optionally) retain the original gendered name colour for characters using a custom colour.
- Automated update checks. The settings button on top-- or on Mac, a new one only visible when there's an update, will glow when a new version of Horizon is available for download. [\[Commit\]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b9189fe9f123dcd2d7a6d6c939e48d744401504b)
  - This also brings back and repurposes the old 3.0 beta channel setting, for checking if pre-release versions are available.

### Fixed

- Fixed icon position in the MacOS installer. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/c73f0549033f53ba679a19cd3946b7e9ebaba1b8)
- Issues with event listeners being assigned twice. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/c1e53c796df75960d34b0e8225e89e3c96a81ff0)
  - This should solve ads showing up more than once in the Recon tab and Ad History menu.
- Character-specific settings potentially being loaded before logging in. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/97e611734bdd0112596f8611e20bcd855e3c90ac)
  - This should fix showing not being able to view logs without logging in first.
- Fixed an issue where the bottom padding of the window would not readjust after maximizing the window (most noticeable by the chat input being cut off) .[[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/520226c026d73b5c9e1164e005150328f17a4a96)
- Fixed event listeners not being properly removed after logging out [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/be76897b0c9596c6663705cc457aadb69be0543d)
  - This should fix issues like Alt-â†‘ and Alt-â†“ making you scroll through multiple conversations instead of only one after relogging.
- Fixed conversation list items not changing color in the Dracula theme when hovering over them. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8a99eb47f3694ddb130aa94b30d37e6d1473b209)
- Fixed cases where conversations could be opened with a nameless character. This would (incorrectly) give a warning about corrupted logs. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/05c763a8955f1113732139cda1a18f33907d7fc4)
  - This also fixes other cases where using slash-commands with an empty name could allow for weird things happening (like ignoring a nameless character).
- Fixed notifications on Windows being labelled by the app's ID instead of the app's name, and clicking a notification while the app is minimized should restore it properly now. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/782236d6574f7e1c3b9686ae71be4df4d1b77637)

### Changed

- Tool tips in the BBCode editor now reflect platform-specific (MacOS) shortcuts. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/40b2ffe)
- Names beyond a certain length are now truncated in the user list, to prevent the layout from breaking. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b828eb3172ca2f254bd45bec86beef4daf4e6378)
  - This should only affect extreme cases, where a name consists of over Â±18 capital letters.
- Character status icons (Looking, Online, Busy, etc.) in the conversation list now match the ones in the user list. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e0865a9a042ef07b96284898e8b109a6202877ce)
- On MacOS, the shortcut to open the developer tools window now matches the one used in Chrome and Safari on that platform (Command-Option-I). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0614adee072d15a5cce46a56a6d0477dec0c9065)

### Non-user facing changes (for developers)

- Fixes the release artefacts directory not being ignored by Git and Prettier. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b5eff723787c1aa9250ba0dbc8db84b1fda3c7f5)
- Removed an unnecessary `include` in `tsconfig.json` that potentially confused LSPs. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0d1926306bbef569a65da0b93d99d1fb25ed4cc5)
- The Prettier pre-commit hook now warns developers _before_ they make a commit, rather than after. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/pull/129/commits/f954d6ec685ea672300a2253553ae5c93d54b13d)
  - This behaviour can be ignored by using `git commit --no-verify [...]`
  - The Prettier format check is also part of the PR CI/CD pipeline now.
