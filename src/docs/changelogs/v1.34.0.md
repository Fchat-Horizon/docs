### Changed

- Removed the ping sound from channel warnings. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/ff1bca7833e87fe99b621946e2ae00c3b4dded58)
  - We originally brought this back, because it was a feature in F-Chat 1.0 and 2.0. But this was a bad decision.

- The CSS rules for applying gender (and bookmark) colors have been changed, to let you more easily write custom CSS for them. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/330d50127aa67225788764913196a51c95435ac4)
- Timestamps for highlighted (pinged, warned) messages now match the background style. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b279ea74b8316f0d4c3402fb8067ef19c0001c86)

  - The order right now is: Pinged messages > Your previous conversation > Messages marked as unread (red color) > Message time > Alphabetical order
- The "Empty customs" warning in the profile analyzer now shows which customs have an empty descriptions. It also doesn't count intentionally blank (ie. with a single space for a description) descriptions as empty. We trust that you're aware that you did that and won't be opinionated about that anymore.

- Viewing your own profile no longer shows infotags marked with a color for compatability with that same character... You can't RP with yourself after all. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/76162fb87d8808d215232d92c7fcd7caa90ed6ad)
- The flag that remembers whether you want to minimize match results from a profile is now split from the one that lets you minimize the profile analyzer. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b380fb4cc4294729d43c3e6ba615df669d551b18)
