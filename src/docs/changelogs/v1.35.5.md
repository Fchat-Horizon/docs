### Changed

- Drastically improved detection of your browser for the "Open in incognito mode" right click option. Linux is now supported as well [[Improvements]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3737b0ea3ad8039a9faba690256b3c6847095a28) [[Linux]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e82f2b0028801608cf91028346e578f2bd51fcd6)
  - If the browser you have set in the advanced app options is different from your computer's default browser, Horizon will try to open incognito links using your custom browser path too.
  - Due to Safari not supporting Private Mode flags for the command line, MacOS support for this feature has not yet been added.
- If you try and change the server host, you'll now get a warning asking you if you are _really_ sure. This is an advanced option after all. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8c626f023e42842077574afad81fca4de1537044)
- Adjusted some matching/ kink-related colors in colorblind mode for better contrast. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/745da3f83cb008067ad310478d9c0db954fa8a82)
- "Yes" is once again the default option when prompted to log out or close a tab. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/14c53f141f793e27dee8e74c2d102091829988b5)
  - Fun fact: This was technically a bug, and "No" was the intended default option, an update in our dependencies unbroke this accidentally. But muscle memory > intent.
- Updated localization files.

### Fixed

- Fixed user avatars being cut off slightly in the conversation list. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/d00f1cdfd1d1d716bd9b4ddc9a1d7bc1db1da6a7)
- `[icon]` tags will now always use the file's aspect ratio. Useful for when your HQ portrait is vertical or horizontal. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/f5225d4d3419a2a973e10ceebf6231c318192124)

### Development

- Updated to Electron v39.2.7 (from v38.7.0) [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/ef558d49c653aace1adff0133b1483d9f4b45eb3)
  - This should fix various issues under Linux, like warped fonts on some desktop compositors.
- Converted `components/character_select.vue` to the composition API. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b304f49b9d0ec6bd6543bfdb6afbe2fd95cbc281)
