### Changed

- The window's base color tries to take your system's light/ dark theme into account, to prevent a flashbang for cases where loading the actual webview is noticeable. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/eb49d1aba0667e46f69cfe420cb52ff2d6a52e7b)
- The typing indicator should be more distinct between "typing" and "paused" states. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b81894b8aac1a29dd9b2a321715f801546b0faf2)
- Updated localization files.
