### Added

- Your character's friends now appear in their own list on top of the friends tab. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1bd8a6afb6f308ba35428d04838ba39198aca238)
  - There is even a setting to hide other friends (the ones that are not friends with your _current_ character), or to group them all together (the vanilla behaviour).
- The profile viewer now has extra filters and sorting options for comparing kinks between you and the profile you're viewing. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/6da8d252ff8b01dc3f01875b84e29a59d30bf8c6)
  - Thank you, @Matthew-X!
- The console view now has an "All friends" tab where you can see all of your friends and bookmarked profiles, even if they are offline. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/110a8534efbf5f5a738fee9dedcbfec0dab630d2)
- You can now navigate between your conversation history with the mouse's back and forwards buttons. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/a10f74f90ea4dda2ce5665a2ce862c83e4f654de)
  - `Alt` + `←` / `→` (or `Cmd` + `[` / `]` on macOS) are also supported.
- Modal dialog windows now have snappy opening and closing animations. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0128f472ef7ee464c04d134f3601e43e6bbdaf96)
- Tabs on the top of the window now also have snappy opening and closing animations. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b3d0eea6dc285b56956960b3683fb306782245d5)
- Added an accessibility setting to disable all animations, regardless of your system's reduced motions preference. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b598237dd80bbdb6f7eb4b5a9e389bebff7cb999)
- `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `Q` now acts like a shortcut to quickly close the app on Windows and Linux. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/4f8f4dd6d072adde2571d269a5cd0499fae259a0)

### Changed

- Dark-dimmed theme had its BBCode colors adjusted from the vanilla values to improve legibility. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/72d99ff3ed20a79088a4393a701e89bce8619c8f)
- Tips of the day now appear on the character select screen! [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/pull/505)
  - If you're an expert user already, you can easily disable these from ever showing up in the app's general settings.
- We redesigned the character settings menu and put most of the settings in appropriate categories, in the hopes that it will help you find settings a bit easier. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/a669f36f71707afbf67ba68d5d4786c870a488dd)
  - The new design with the coloured buttons is in preparation for the new, _new_ settings menus where you will be able to set character settings on a global level. We're working on that still, but stay tuned.
- The MacOS version now uses a proper version of the Tahoe-style icon if you're on MacOS 26 (or later). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3e3c5e98bf0f031d2e2c909cca10158f60137931)

### Fixed

- The BBCode previewer won't be eating your other keyboard shortcuts so much anymore. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1572b662840c3e98448df4f16706cf60b1379075)
- Fixed the dictionary lookup breaking once you disconnect and reconnect in the same tab. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/141976a834908186d72641f8c36147bccbec7f2b)
- Fixed the context menu showing an option to pin an eicon when viewing logs before having logged in.
- Fixed issues with the image previewer doing things it shouldn't do (like opening links) because of redirects. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e525bfe0cf2bd1f3625c5b731de38ad1334101e2)
- Fixed some cases where custom kinks were sorted differently from the website (most notably for people who manually sort their customs with whitespace characters). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/5123c86c5c7e1b1e898b6a760de7c98a98ae25d8)
- Custom profile portraits with broken URLs now get reset into their default ones. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9b0dda8555e1a507fe4e3aacb0fc499a4dea7063)
  - If your own custom portrait is broken, the profile analyser on your profile page will tell you too.
- Fixed pasting urls with multiple square brackets (`[`/`]`) only fixing the first pair. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/742a1d10e360d9c67c26f5df2d05f4e06e02ad4e)
