# Horizon 1.35.0

Download [here](https://horizn.moe/download.html?ver=v1.35.0).

### Added

- Channel member lists now feature extensive filter options. Sorting has been moved to this pop-over menu as well. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/d9228c052920fefd1ed62d42b7fcbd934b3bd618)
  - You can even enable persistent filters under "Character settings > Smart filters".
  - Thank you, @Matthew-X!
- Added a conversation-level setting to disable that specific conversation from showing up as "unread" when new messages appear. Unless you get pinged, of course. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/41513f066de4e9adc2396a8b57b38d7bbf5225dc)
- Added a new light mode theme: "Snowed In". [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/207aa9b7d45d4f8f41a9703b124ca58d5fd51be3)
- Added settings to determine how long a profile's data can be stored on your computer, and how many profiles can be kept in active system memory at once. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/5526219900318b636abf59e41ec5c31e65556b87)
  - There was technically always a setting for the former, you just could not access it from any menu and would need to edit the settings file manually. The default value (30 days) remains unchanged though.
- Added "Hide" and "Hide Others" menu items for MacOS, and made Cmd + W close the active dialog. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0e7caeb38db6065154ae802acce23c388bb5e1e4)

### Changed

- Custom name colors now load automatically. We also implemented a bunch of in-memory profile cache improvements to accommodate this. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2ff45399718bc75b517d8f32f2799840d3657967)
  - This only happens for profiles you loaded at any point in time, for one reason or another, rather than _all_ of them at once. We don't want Horizon users to start barraging the F-List servers with requests just for opening a room with 3000+ members in it.
  - Overall though, you should see memory usage over time increase a lot less than before.
- The conversation settings menu has been given a slight facelift with coloured buttons instead of dropdowns. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/94de46fe80a23bebd3a7f61e567642c1afd4e46a)
  - These buttons were designed for the new settings menus, for when character settings can be defined globally. Expect this to come out soon.
- Updated localization files.

### Fixed

- Fixed an old 3.0 issue where "toast" messages, like setting a channel to public, would display unparsed BBCode. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/d6b79cc521eb38e7cf70a980e2e949f9aec25689)
- Fixed issues with video previews for sites like Rule34.xxx. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/6c1fcf5195d32dd55288e2f8694ab55fa394a5bd)
- Fixed `/warn` text in modern chat view having horrible, illegible colors in some themes. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/17e024f12a989348d857a2099a21108fc8da8cc0)
- Fixed themes not correctly showing as the root element's class name if using the "Sync with system theme". For setting custom CSS on a per-theme level. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/5a860a2c7d53cf239c627475930dd08cea2e3f2a)
- Fixed messages having a broken layout in the Recon tab when using modern chat view. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9ad4269b84771f9e1c6760bc9f0ed58484adb766)

### Development

- Converted the following components to the composition API:
  - `components/date_display.vue` [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1755e55b9ffa090465342d7873481b784046576b)
  - `site/character_page/kink.vue` and `site/character_page/kinks.vue` [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/909fe06a9a523834ab777a8891cc3780d69a0d7a)
- Dropdown components now take their menu's size from both the button and the optional splitter. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8ddcaf093402e90ae1a66807e1059b8f1b66ed8c)
- Added direct .app builds for MacOS. For building locally. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/7704966c4e26de8154ddb3315639e32d47265c3e)
