# Horizon 1.32.2

Download [here](https://horizn.moe/download.html?ver=v1.32.2).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> We are hard at work updating Horizon to use Vue 3 instead of Vue 2, [which should have been done well during Rising's lifespan](https://blog.vuejs.org/posts/vue-2-eol).
> This means we might slow down a bit on non-pre release updates, until we've gotten 2.0.0 (or whatever version number that would be) in a state where we feel it's stable enough. But unless something goes terribly wrongâ€“ or we wind up with a truckload of bugs as a result of this update process, this won't take more than a few weeks. ðŸ¤žðŸ¤ž
> If you're anxiously waiting for new stuff after this update, and it's been a while. Know that we're probably busy with this.

### Fixed

- Fixed issues where the eicon picker's cache would get corrupted during a botched upgrade to any 1.32.X version from an earlier version. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9a114a16c688961fa25d9bf90e9b8dd47c1de756)
  - This will also make sure that any `eicons.json` files that have already been broken because of this issue are automatically fixed.
- Fixes some cases where custom name colors wouldn't be applied even though the BBCode formatting was valid. This mostly happened if you had the `[color]` tag inside or right next to another one. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/831ffbc838e5adf656457daa8e2524929086b24f)
- Fixes the external browser setting no longer working in the new settings menu. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b9b0adf0a75ab07a33cfa4d64eb63569508228f1)
- Fixes some instances where using the wrong capitalisation with an `[icon]` tag would link to an improperly capitalised profile preview. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/93247fd76b134162ae92e6ef450b6756b82b0f7c)
- Fixes the 'About Horizon' window being cut off on Windows. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/6020e542358c465343bd21d7caeffcac9806aa8b)
- Fixes the badge on the taskbar icon disappearing if you close a window and reopen it through the tray icon. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2d8ab92f5497c3cf490dc4247caa926b2174f6e8)
- Fixes issues where closing the app to dock on MacOS would make the dock icon not respond to input, or let you break the app by clicking stuff in the menu bar you are not supposed to be able to without a window. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/4053389561b0552b18a7265a6108068110cc1e04)
- Fixes a bug where you could break the amount of tabs allowed by using the New Tab shortcut. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9af50faef58fd34bb2e8809e27eb9d29b992abf4)

### Changed

- System broadcasts are now thrown into the console tab instead of pinging and notifying you for every single conversation you are in. The console tab glows just like if you were pinged when there is an announcement. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/37a54fe06c4e1dfc876bc6b3004ad27cd2403512)
- If "Close to system tray" is enabled, you now get only one tray icon that lets you open any tab, instead of one tray icon per tab. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/0176a37f3ae59a083a7a901b31b785e29aff0d70)

### Development

- Prettier updated to version 3.6.0 [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/1d3e9f3020f23c59a9919b1273c82785e4728c39)
- Cleaned up the profile viewer code so it won't cry about not having a specific tag anymore. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b4e11d4239b21966de9971a5fa0c553892e705ce)
