### Changed

### Security & Development

- Updated Electron to 37.2.0. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/24791477c245ad9ca25222cfded78871f852d176)
- Updated Vue-Loader to 15.11 so we don't have to deal with Babel Traverse vulnerabilities anymore. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/6ec6ad6840d61fc5776f79732c348d6056acfd13)
- Updated Vue from 2.6 to 2.7. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8b907f21aeafc08559ff34b1eee5552d1b73eb24)
  - In the 1.32.2 changelog we mentioned wanting to update to Vue 3 and that updates might pause because of that, but going through 2.7 first means we can do the necessary changes gradually instead of having to edge and drop all of the component changes in one go. It's a pain to have to deal with wanting to update a component in the development branch while the Vue 3 branch has to then have those changes backported to them, but the backend also relies on some Vue 2-specific code and slowly whittling this down will probably go way better.
- We now support Gentoo ebuilds! Check out all of our Linux package versions in the [Readme!](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/blob/main/README.md#supported-distros) [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/horizon-packages/commit/9803c4373ebdfbba6e47e4c475b549c3868934f6) by @CodingWithAnxiety
- Made some BBCode parsing code more generic, instead of split up between standard and chat parsers. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e52dd3b6a7655ffaeeeaa7c2dacea8e2d4861fb2)
