# Horizon 1.28.0 

### Welcome back, everyone!

**F-chat rising has died, F-chat horizion has risen!**

I won't get into the details, but the owner of Rising got banned from F-LIST and, in a fit, deleted the rising repo off of github.

This is a fork of Risinger, specifically, with the aim to maintain rising under a new name.

# BE AWARE!

This is still in early work, and WILL have bugs. You CAN lose character data, so back up logs REGULARLY!

We're still working to remove mentions of rising, but I wanted to get a working build out ASAP.

We're also working to bring back the wiki. If anyone has archives of it's pages, please reach out!

Danke!
