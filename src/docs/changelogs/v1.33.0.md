# Horizon 1.33.0

> [!NOTE]
> ***A brief statement from the Horizon Project overseer***
> When I put this project together, I never expected it to take off nearly as fast as it did, nor did I ever expect it to get this big.
> Originally, this was meant to be a hobby project so I could still get updates after the death of rising, but now it has a well-loved community of people who are constantly working on it.
> 1.33.0 is, I would argue, our biggest update to date. And I hope you all love it.
> Thank you for all your love and support.
> â€” Rose

### UI Changes overview

- Generic UI elements like tabs and "cards" (used to denote specific floating sections like the parts on the profile viewer or the sign in screen) have been given a facelift so we're not just using the vanilla Bootstrap styles.
  - The general idea was to go for a more "consistent" look, so that both our custom components and stock ones blend together more. We also figured that they could do with a little eyecandy without compromising on visual clarity.
  - Other changes to those elements, like with tabs, were done for extra visual polish. Tabs now always match the colour of their contents and have no seams, window modal dialogs no longer take up unnecessary width and have a cute little icon :)
- Various elements now use a "hidden", slim scroll bar that only shows when hovering.
- _Many_ tiny nitpicks and inconsistencies addressed.
- The "User Menu" right click menu has been polished and handles very long unbroken names better.
- The sidebar has been slimmed down: buttons replaced action links, and conversation-related actions moved to relevant lists.
  - The note/ messages counters have been integrated into the sidebar too, instead of displaying as a toast dialog on the bottom.
  - All buttons and functions should still be accessible from within a single click though. Aside from the "Edit ads" button, which has been moved to the Ad Launcher, and the Profile Analyser. Which is now no longer a separate window but has been integrated into the profile viewer for your own characters.
  - It should overall feel a bit more familiar to people using modern chat programs.
- BBCode colours for white, gray and black updated in all light/dark themes for legibility; most other colours in the light theme adjusted as they were hard to read.
  - Since this removes the "glow" effect that black text has in certain theme and was used for certain cool effects, the setting for bbcode colours mentioned above also adds the glow back to those colours.
- The light theme has (mostly) been fixed throughout and is now on par with the dark themes.
- Improved visual consistency between the Eicon Picker and the rest of the app.
- The profile viewer has been significantly polished too.
  - The side bar's buttons have been updated to match the look used for other buttons throughout the app.
  - Looking at your own character(s) now shows (preliminary!) buttons similar to the website. You can also see your private friends lists now.
  - The dialog for editing a memo has been changed to match the one in the user right click menu.
  - The profile analyser is now displayed on your own profile instead, inside the collapsible box used for match results on others' profiles.
  - The window will no longer shift around depending on whether or not a profile is loading/ unavailable, smaller or full size. This also includes a nice little loading animation (please do not look up what they're called).
  - Massively nested `[indent]` tags, used to create a padding effect, no longer have their contents completely squashed on narrower screen sizes.
  - Various elements (such as the buttons above the kink list, the "Info" tab's contents and the sidebar's contents now scale properly at various screen sizes.
  - Dropdown items and the kink lists have been slimmed down a bit. The kink lists now have a bit of a coloured flair similar to the website's profile page.
- Buttons on the window title bar now blend in better with the background.
  - On platforms that have a button for the app menu, a specific button was added to directly open the settings. The app menu button has been given a different icon to better show off its purpose.
- Text contrast fixes are now applied globally across appropriate elements (e.g. buttons). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8480f9ce4469ca2ef5e0a8e0e9e9b6a12c30cade)
  - This also fixes some cases where theme colours weren't being applied properly to some elements (like conversation lists in the Dracula theme).

### Removed

- Extra, unused CHANGELOG.md in `electron/CHANGELOG.md`. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8d97fb9aef01638b1d89324e3aa62d0690d9a842)
