# Horizon 1.32.1

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This update changes the way global settings are accessed. Backing up your logs is recommended.

### Added

- General app settings now have a proper preferences window. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/d1578dc6ccaba15e56e0b1eec758f41887b74d90)
  - You can find it under Horizon > Preferences in the app menu.
  - In the nearby future, most of the character-specific settings will be moved to this global settings menu, where they will be applied globally across your characters. Settings like your pings, or other similar settings that can also be set on a per-conversation level will remain character-specific though. This is mostly for settings that have little business being tied to your character (like font size).

### Fixed

- Installing an update now displays the proper changelog instead of the one from the previous version. Oops! [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/324c9d347e9ec751cca152abf00364438aa7ee12)

- Clicking the update prompt now properly closes the app instead of leaving you with a tables window. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/badc733049f3c3342fe1c95011c8e3bcd05d51bb)

- Having a broken URL for your HQ avatar no longer prevents your custom color from displaying either. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/efe8f252294c140177e842d0928f45e0b82f2adf)
- Fixes the profile assistant linking to a nonexistent page when informing you about HQ portraits. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/3341f88941ffa3ab29830fdd1674fb38367746c1)
