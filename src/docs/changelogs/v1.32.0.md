# Horizon 1.32.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to _downgrade_ from 1.32.0 or later to an earlier version, you will need to manually delete the `eicon.json` file in your Horizon data folder, or the EIcon search window might not show all results anymore.
> Please consult [this](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/blob/main/PRIVACY.md) file on where to find this folder.
> For regular users, this should be no concern though.

### Added

- New EIcon Selector and Store update, significantly improving the EIcon selection UI and handling. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/2439abc9253ca87a510d3ac5bc8abded9f1b5d68)
  - You should see a **_massive_** decrease in memory per tab now, and searching for eicons is now a lot snappier.
  - Also fixes some issues where searchig for EIcons with a leading space wouldn't work. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/b88290eef690fdd3111abae52b6c41124b3e8663)
  - _Also_ fixes the EIcon search potentially messing up if Xariah's API is having issues. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/130d91b7fca64740cf7c08ca05f768fc83d3c0e6)
  - Special thanks to @FireUnderTheMountain for helping investigate this, and subsequently writing the PR.
- Experimental gender matcher rework (community feedback appreciated). [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/7b35203e4e77245ff1864fcf505646bd55855b00)
  - Read more about it [here](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/pull/173).
  - TL;DR: Gender and orientation are now a single score, determined primarily by your default kink gender preferences, while your orientation is used as a fallback. Orientation matching for nonbinary characters is also less dogmatic now.
  - More changes to the matcher are planned, including reassessing how species are determined.
- Consistency applied to most instances of the app name. We are now just "Horizon". [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/8f6abc30ffcfd6cfd1b1e4f64e494b56efbff1da)
  - We have a _temporary_ new logo to go with this change. If you don't like it, don't worry: We'll replace it with something better and less temporary soon enough.
