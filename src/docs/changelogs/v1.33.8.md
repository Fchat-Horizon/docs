## Horizon 1.33.8

### Fixed

- Hotfix for broken notifications [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/e47e37359de1bbba42d9074464a01eae42cb00f4)
  - The previous patch was quickly put out for a security issue that has been a thing since Rising, but we were so strict in blocking off permissions that we also broke the one instance where it was fine to have some permissions: Sending notifications from the chat sandbox.
