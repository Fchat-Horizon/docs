### Fixed

- Fixed the Open Conversation and Join Channel buttons being draggable and messing up the Alt+Arrow keys order. Also fixed an issue where the Open Conversation modal would eat the conversation view. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/ea982ddec8be589b0bed9dd0444c5ffef2a0c0da)
- Font Awesome icons have been updated to v6, and a missing icon for the "Show Ad log" option has been added. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/43ec2985fd43696350e53e1a27d19d42cf39621c)
  - The differences for existing icons are pretty marginal, but in general icons are now slightly more consistent with each other.
- Fixed the slash-command for setting your status (`/status busy`) being case sensitive [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/9554511ff9cbf1395f4444696ab425ca8a05cc7d)
- Reverted a previous change that was causing issues with displaying the match result while searching for characters because of an event listener check. [[Commit]](https://github.com/Fchat-Horizon/Horizon/commit/849e2ce7c9a516c0da4be6f7d3bcaa3af4315f18)
