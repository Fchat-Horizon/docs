Horizon contains a lot of features— A lot of which can be disabled if you don't want them! A non exhaustive list is as follows:

Come from 3.0, or you don't even know what a "Rising" is? Take a look at [what else you're getting](rising). Check out the general [quality of life changes](quality-of-life) while you're at it too.

## More customization

extra sound themes (soon make own), custom css, more granular settings
Horizon comes with a whole bunch of extra themes— that you can even sync with your computer's light/ dark mode, to give you something that really suits your tastes. Not enough options? You can even write your own custom CSS to style everything *just* the way you like it.

You can even pick various sound themes for your notifications and, in the future, make your own sound packs with ease.

## Custom character colors & High quality portraits
Want high quality portraits? Simply place `[url=link.to.url.com]Horizon Portrait[/url]` in your characters bio. Want a custom color? Do `[color=colorname]Horizon Color[/color]` to set one as well!

## Improved Rising features

- Pinning statuses in your status history
- Automatic ads can now have a custom posting interval
- The profile analyzer has been worked into your own profile, and now gives you more clarity in what the matcher does.
