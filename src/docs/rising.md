# Rising Features


> [!INFO]
> This page is still a major work in progress, or a stub.

Horizon is a continuation of the, now defunct, F-Chat Risingâ€” which itself is a customized fork of the standalone 3.0 client. Because of that, all of the cool features (except that one not-so-cool one) are all part of Horizon too!

Here are some of the standout additions:

## Character and link previews

## Character matching

## Automatic ads

## Status saving

## EIcon selector and color picker

## High quality, and animated avatars
