# Rising Features

Horizon is a continuation of the, now defunct, F-Chat Risingâ€” which itself is a customized fork of the standalone 3.0 client. Because of that, all of the cool features (except that one not-so-cool one) are all part of Horizon too! 

We've retooled some of those as well:

## Status history

You can pin any status you've used to your list of statuses to select from, so you don't have to keep tabs on whether it's about to drop out. On that note, you can see how many statuses you have left until old ones are automatically cleared out, but we've also increased the limit to 15.

## Character and link previews

With time, many sites had their previews slowly stop working in Rising, but we've kept the list a lot more up to date. Never feel bad again about sending your friend an "x.com" link instead of a "twitter.com" one because it wouldn't show the preview anymore.

## Character matching

The profile analyzer that helps you get better matching results has now been worked into your own profile, instead of being shoved into the sidebar in the main chat view.

For the future, we also have plans to adjust the matcher to user feedback, though one important change we already implemented means that nonbinary characters are no longer automatically considered a negative match for people who did not specifically select that gender as a default kink.

## Automatic ads

- You can now post ads with custom intervals.
- Rising was set to phase out the per-channel ad settings, but never got around to it. Our plan is to work these two functions together into one.


## EIcon selector and color picker

You can right-click any Eicon you see in the wild to easily save it to your list of favourites. The color picker has also been upgraded with an auto-completing keyboard shortcut.

## High quality, and animated avatars

We support more sites, including imgchest.com and toyhou.se.
