# Custom Name Colors and Avatars

## Custom colors

Setting a custom name color for yourself or other Horizon users to see is pretty straight-forward. All you have to do is add the following BBCode somewhere on your character profile:
```bbcode
[color=red]Horizon Color[/color]
```

And, bam! Your custom color is set. You can choose any of the BBCode colors supported on the website:

- ``red``
- ``orange``
- ``yellow``
- ``green``
- ``cyan``
- ``purple``
- ``blue``
- ``pink``
- ``black``
- ``brown``
- ``white``
- ``gray``

## Custom High Quality Avatars

Setting a custom high quality avatar for yourself is similarly easy. Just add the following link BBCode to your profile, replacing the url with the link to your own image.
```bbcode
[url=https://static.f-list.net/images/charimage/36573821.gif]Horizon Portrait[/url]
```

For backwards compatability with Rising users, ``Rising Portrait`` is also still supported.
